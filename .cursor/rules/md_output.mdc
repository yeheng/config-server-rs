Format your response in markdown according to the following requirements:

- When proposing an edit to a markdown file, first evaluate whether the content will contain code snippets
- If the content contains no code snippets, enclose the entire response in backticks with 'markdown' as the language identifier
- If the content includes code snippets, ensure all code blocks are indented with exactly 2 spaces and specify the correct language for proper rendering
- Only 2-space indentation is allowed for code blocks - level 0 and 4 space indentations are not permitted
- Automatically correct any code block indentation that doesn't follow the 2-space rule
